#Getting Started

###Clone this repository.
  
    $ cd ~/Repositories
    $ git clone https://github.com/elixir-pdx/zee_pipes.git
    $ cd zee_pipes

#Hacking

You may find it helpful to play with your code in Elixir's `iex` interactive console. If you want to do that and autoload the console session with your code then you can do the following from the project root:

    $ iex -S mix

That will make sure that you're running `iex` inside your project's build environment.

#Building

To compile your project simply run this from the project root:

    $ mix compile

#Testing

To run the test suite defined in `test/zee_pipes_test.exs` then run this from the project root:

    $ mix test
